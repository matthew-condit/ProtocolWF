Toxikon Protocol Manager Windows Form
Windows Form .NET Based

TPM is the original developers notes on features and download location 

Runs the protocol system for Toxikon.  Full CRUD application, pretty simple for the most part.  A few messy locations, but it's a pretty straight forward windows form applications.  A couple of hacky locations, including giving Doc Control full access to protocol number admin edit page.  Might want to change that back in the future.  

Improvements: 

Remove admin privledge from Doc Control on that one page
I think that's it, maybe clean up a couple of the controllers
